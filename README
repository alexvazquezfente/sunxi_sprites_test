Compile (it does not need any dependency):
make

Execute:
./sprites_test

Test:
1. Compile the program
2. Configure the display to 1080p50 o 1080p60 (screen0_output_mode = 9 or screen0_output_mode = 10 in script.fex)
3. Generate the script.bin using sunxi-tools
4. Replace script.bin in boot partition
5. Reboot
6. Play a video using any supported player (e.g. mplayer)
7. Simultaneously run ./sprites_test

The program just opens the sprite layer for 10 seconds (it does not need to draw nothing to it).
If all is ok, the video will continue playing normally.
If not, you will see the shaking screen for 10 seconds.
